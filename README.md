Assignment # 4 - SQL Project (Part 1):  From ER Design ToImplementation - Paper Review Database(Due: 4/21/2019 @ 11:59PM) [150 Points]

In this project you will take an existing ER design and implement a relational database.  
You will be implementing the database that we modeled the “paper reviewers” database we designed in Assignment 3’s problem # 3.34 (see the assignment’s key for details).This project will be split into two parts. 
The first part will include setting up your developmentenvironment (installing MySQL), writing SQL scripts to create the tables (entities), constraintsetc modeled in the ER Diagram. You will also write SQL scripts to insert data into all the tablesyou created. 
The second part will include creating a simple Java application to query andupdate your database.

Part A: Install MySQLGo to the link below and follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows,Mac OS etc). Note, in this tutorial there are examples of SQL queries for creating tables andinserting data into the tables you created. 
You will use this tutorial in Part B.https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/Part B: Implement Database Schema For “Paper Reviews” DatabaseUsing the tutorials in the above link; implement all entities, constraints etc from Assignment 3’s problem # 3.34 (use the ER Diagram given in the assignment solutions document).
Note, you must use SQL queries to create your database schema. You are NOT to use a GUI(graphical interface), you must use the command line. This is to ensure you learn to write SQLcommands to creating your database schema.Part C: Populate Your DatabaseUsing the tutorials in the above link; populate your database using SQL INSERT statements
To Submit The Assignment (Read Carefully):
●Create a github account.
●Create 
​public
​github repository and add all of your source code for this assignment tothe repository. 
​(See the “getting started with github” document in the “CourseDocuments folder for help)
​Note, your source code includes the following:
○sql script files used to create and populate your database (all create and insertqueries etc)
●Make sure to add a README file to the root of your repository that describes the site you have implemented.
●What to submit? 
​The link to your public repository will all the sql scripts used to implement and populate your database. 
Do NOT send me zip files of sql scripts, it will NOT be accepted.
